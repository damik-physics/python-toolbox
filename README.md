# Python Toolbox

A curated collection of small, practical Python projects and automation tools to solve everyday problems, demonstrate specific programming concepts, or explore a useful technique in modern Python development.

The goal of this repository is to build a clear, structured portfolio showing clean and maintainable code as well as tracking consistent improvement in Python skills.

## Contents

### 1. Todo CLI

A simple command line task manager that stores tasks in JSON format.  
Demonstrates:

- CLI workflow design  
- File handling with `pathlib`  
- Persistent storage  
- Modular code structure  
- Input validation and error handling  

Located in: `todo_cli/`

### 2. Additional Mini Projects

This repository will be expanded with further tools, including:

- file automation utilities
- data parsing scripts
- argparse-based command line tools  
- SQLite-backed utilities  
- colored terminal apps  
- testable modules with separated logic and I/O  

Each project is self-contained with its own module folder and README.

## Philosophy

This repository follows three principles:

1. **Clarity**  
   Code should be readable, predictable, and easy to maintain.

2. **Purpose**  
   Each project solves a concrete problem or showcases a specific technique.

3. **Progress**  
   New folders will appear over time, reflecting continuous skill development.
